# Image Caption Generator

## What is CNN:
- Convolutional Neural Networks are specialized deep neural networks which can process data that has input shape like a d2 matrix
= images are easily represented as a 2D matrix and CNN is useful in working with images
- CNN is mainly used for image classification and identification

## What is LSTM
- Long Short Term Memory, a type  of neural network 
- advanced from RNN (recurrent neural network), but proven its effectiveness from the traditional RNN by overcoming the short term memory.

## What is DenseNet 201 Architecture
- architecture used for extracting features from images
- Since the Global Average Pooling layer is selected as the final layer of the DenseNet201 model for our feature extraction, our image embeddings will be a vector of size 1920.
