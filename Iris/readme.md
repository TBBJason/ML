# Notes

## requirements/dependencies
- It's a good habit to start using requirements.txt, inputting all the dependencies there and then installing through
- pip install -r requirements.txt


## Univariate/Multivariate Plots
- Univariate plots better understand each attribute
- Multivariate plots better understand the relationship between attributes
